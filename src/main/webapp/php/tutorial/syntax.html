<h1>PHP 5 Syntax</h1>
<p>A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.</p>
<h2>Basic PHP Syntax</h2>
<p>A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.</p>
<p>A PHP script starts with &lt;?php and ends with ?&gt;:</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;?php
// PHP code goes here
?&gt;
</pre></code>
<p>The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".</p>
<p>A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.</p>
<p>Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My first PHP page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;?php
echo "Hello World!";
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
<p><b>Note:</b>PHP statements end with a semicolon(;).</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Comments in PHP</h2>
<p>A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.</p>
<p>Comments can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let others understand what you are doing</li>
<li>Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP supports several ways of commenting:</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
// This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment

/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/

// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
echo $x;
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
<hr/>

<h2>PHP Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.</p>
<p>In the example below, all three echo statements below are legal (and equal):</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
ECHO "Hello World!&lt;br&gt;";
echo "Hello World!&lt;br&gt;";
EcHo "Hello World!&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
<p>However; all variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
<p>In the example below, only the first statement will display the value of the $color variable (this is because $color, $COLOR, and $coLOR are treated as three different variables):</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "&lt;br&gt;";
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "&lt;br&gt;";
echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
</body>
</html>
