<h1>PHP 5 switch Statement</h1>
<p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
<h2>The PHP switch Statement</h2>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code><pre>
witch (n) {
    case label1:
        code to be executed if n=label1;
        break;
    case label2:
        code to be executed if n=label2;
        break;
    case label3:
        code to be executed if n=label3;
        break;
    ...
    default:
        code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}
</pre></code>
<p>This is how it works: First we have a single expression n (most often a variable), that is evaluated once. The value of the expression is then compared with the values for each case in the structure. If there is a match, the block of code associated with that case is executed. Use <b>break</b> to prevent the code from running into the next case automatically. The <b>default</b> statement is used if no match is found.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<code><pre>
&lt;?php
$favcolor = "red";

switch ($favcolor) {
    case "red":
        echo "Your favorite color is red!";
        break;
    case "blue":
        echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
        break;
    case "green":
        echo "Your favorite color is green!";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}
?&gt;
</pre></code>
