</div>
<code>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM Orders

<div class="notice">
<b>NOtice that the BETWEEN operator can produce different result in different databases!</b><br/>
In some databases,BETWEEN selects fields that are between and excluding the test values.<br/>
In other databases, BETWEEN selects fields that are between and including the test value.<br/>
And in other databases, BETWEEN selects fields between the test values, including the first test value and 
excluding the last test value.<br/>
<b>Therefore:Check how your database treats the BETWEEN operator!</b>
