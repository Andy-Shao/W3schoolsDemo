<h1>The SQL DELETE Statement</h1>
<p>The DELETE statment is used to delete rows in a table.</p>
<h1>SQL DELETE Syntax</h1>
<div class="form">DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column=some_value;</div>
<div class="notice">
<p><b>Notice the WHERE clause in the SQL DELETE statement!</b></p>
<p>The WHERE clause specifies which record or records that should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause,
all records will be deleted!</p>
</div>
<h1>Delete All Data</h1>
<p>It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure,
attribute, and indexes will be intact:</p>
<div class="form">
DELETE FROM table_name<br/>
or<br/>
DELETE * FROM table_name<br/>
</div>
<p><b>Note:</b> Be very careful when deleting records. You cannot undo this statement!</p>
