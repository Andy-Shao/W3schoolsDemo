<p>The SQL UNION operator combines the result of two or more SELECT statements.</p>
<h1>The SQL UNION Operator</h1>
<p>The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.</p>
<p>Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns.
The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement 
must be in the same order.</p>
<h2>SQL UNION Syntax</h2>
<div class="form">
<code>
<pre>
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<p><b>Note</b>: The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate
values, use the ALL keyword with UNION.</p>
<p><b>PS</b>: The column names in the result-set of UNION are usually equal to the column names in the
first SELECT statement in the UNION.</p>
<h1>SQL UNION Example</h1>
<div class="form">
<code>
<pre>
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<p><b>Note</b>: UNION cannot be used do to list ALL cities from the two tables. If several customers and
suppliers share the same city, each city will only be listed once. UNION selects only distinct values.
Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!</p>
<h1>SQL UNION ALL Example</h1>
<p>The following SQL statement uses UNION ALL to select <b>all</b> cities form the "Customers" and "Suppliers"
tables:</p>
<div class="form">
<code>
<pre>
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<h1>SQL UNION ALL With WHERE</h1>
<p>The following SQL statement uses UNION ALL to select <b>all German</b> cities from the "Customers" and
"Suppliers" tables:</p>
<div class="form">
<code>
<pre>
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
