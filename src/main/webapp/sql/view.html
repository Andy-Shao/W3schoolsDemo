<p>A view is a virtual table.</p>
<p>This chapter shows how to create, update, and delete a view.</p>
<hr/>

<h1>SQL CREATE VIEW Statement</h1>
<p>In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.</p>
<p>A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one for 
more real tables in the database.</p>
<p>You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were
coming from one single table.</p>
<h2>SQL CREATE VIEW Syntax</h2> 
<div class="form"><code><pre>
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
</pre></code></div>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: A view always shows up-to-date data! Then database engine recreates the data, using the 
view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view.
</p>

<h1>SQL CREATE VIEW Example</h1>
<p>If you have the Northwind database you can see that it has several views installed by default.</p>
<p>
The view "Current Product List" lists all active products from the "Products" table. The view is created
with the following SQL:
</p>
<div class="form"><code><pre>
CREATE VIEW [Current Product List] AS
SELECT ProductID, ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE Discontinued=No
</pre></code></div>
<hr/>

<h1>SQL Updating a View</h1>
<p>You can update a view by using the following syntax:</p>
<h2>SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax</h2>
<div class="form"><code><pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
</pre></code></div>
<hr/>

<h1>SQL Dropping a View</h1>
<p>you can delete a view with the DROP VIEW command.</p>
<h2>SQL DROP VIEW Syntax</h2>
<div class="form"><code><pre>
DROP VIEW view_name
</pre></code></div>
</body>
