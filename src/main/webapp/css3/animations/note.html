<h1>CSS3 Animations</h1>
<p>With CSS3, we can create animations which can replace Flash animations, animated images, and JavaScripts in
existing web pages.</p>
<hr/>

<h1>CSS3 @keyframes Rule</h1>
<p>The @keyframes rule is where the animation is created.</p>
<p>Specify a CSS style inside the @keyframes rule and the animation will gradually change from the current 
style to the new style.</p>
<hr/>

<h1>CSS3 Animation</h1>
<p>When an animation is created in the @keyframe rule, you must bind it to a selector, otherwise the animation
will have no effect.</p>
<p>Bind the animation to a selector(element) by specifying at least these two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the animation</li>
<li>the duration of the animation</li>
</ul>
<a href="css3_animation.html">Example</a>
<i><p>
<b>Note:</b> If the duration part is not specified, the animation will have no effect, because the default
value is 0.
</p></i>
<hr/>

<h1>What Are CSS3 Animations?</h1>
<p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.</p>
<p>You can change as many properties you want, as many times you want.</p>
<p>You can specify when the change will happen in percent, or you can use the keywords "from" and "to"
(which represents 0% and 100%).</p>
<p>0% represents the start of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.</p>
<a href="what_are_css3_animations.html">Example: Change the background color when the animation is 25%, and
50%, and again when the animation is 100% complete</a>
<a href="what_are_css3_animations2.html">Example: Change the background color and the position when the 
animation is 25%, 50%, 75%, and again when the animation is 100% complete</a>
<hr/>

<h1>More Animation Examples</h1>
<p>The example below uses seven of the animation properties:</p>
<a href="more_animation_examples.html">Example</a>
<p>The same animation effect as the example above (except the animation-play-state property).
However, here we are using the shorthand animation property:</p>

<h1>CSS3 Animation Properties</h1>
<p>The following table list the @keyframes rule and all the animation properties:</p>
<table border="1">
<thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th><th>CSS</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>@keyframes</td><td>Specifies the animation</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation</td><td>A shorthand property for setting all the animation proerties, except the
animation-play-state and the animation-fill-mode proerty</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-delay</td><td>Specifies when the animation will start</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-direction</td><td>Specifies whether or not the animation should pay in reverse on 
alternate cycles</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-duration</td><td>Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds an animation takes to complete
one cycle</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-fill-mode</td><td>Specifies what styles will apply for element when the animation is not 
playing (when it is finished, or when it has a "delay")</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-iteration-count</td><td>Specifies the number of time an animation should be palyed</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-name</td><td>Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-play-state</td><td>Specifies whether the animation is running or paused</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>animation-timing-function</td><td>Specifies the speed curve of the animation</td><td>3</td></tr>
