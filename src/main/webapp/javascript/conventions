* use camelCase for identifier names(variable and function).
* Declarations on Top
* Spaces Around Operators. i.e x = 5 + 6; [40, 100, 1, 5]
* Always use 4 spaces for indentation of code blocks.
* Line Length < 80.


Naming Conventions
Always use the same naming convention for all your code. Fore example:
* Variable and function names written as camelCase
* Global variable written in UPPERCASE
* Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
