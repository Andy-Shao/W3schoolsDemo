<h1>XPath Tutorial</h1>
<p>XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.</p>
<p>XPath is a major element in W3C's XSLT standard - and XQuery and XPointer are both built on 
XPath expressions.</p>

<h2>What is XPath?</h2>
<img src="../../resources/images/xml/xpath1.gif"/>
<ul>
<li>XPath is a syntax for defining parts of an XML document</li>
<li>XPath uses path expressions to navigate in XML documents</li>
<li>XPath contains a library of standard functions</li>
<li>XPath is a major element in XSLT</li>
<li>XPath is a W3C recommendation</li>
</ul>

<h2>XPath Path Expressions</h2>
<p>XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path 
expressions look very much like the expressions you see when you work with a traditional computer 
file system.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XPath Standard Functions</h2>
<p>XPath includes over 100 built-in functions. There are functions for string values, numeric 
values, date and time comparison, node and QName manipulation, sequence manipulation, Boolean 
values, and more.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XPath is Used in XSLT</h2>
<p>XPath is a major element in the XSLT standard. Without XPath knowledge you will not be able to 
create XSLT documents.</p>
<p>XQuery and XPointer are both built on XPath expressions. XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same 
data model and support the same functions and operators.</p>
