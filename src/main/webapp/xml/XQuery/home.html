<h1>XQuery Tutorial</h1>
<p>XQuery is to XML what SQL is to database tables.</p>
<p>XQuery is designed to query XML data - not just XML files, but anything that can appear as 
XML, including databases.</p>
<code><pre>
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book
where $x/price&gt;30
order by $x/title
return $x/title
</pre></code>

<h2>XQuery is About Querying XML</h2>
<p>XQuery is a language for finding and extracting elements and attributes from XML 
documents.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a question that XQuery could solve:</p>
<p>"Select all CD records with a price less than $10 from the CD collection stored in the XML 
document called cd_catalog.xml"</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XQuery and XPath</h2>
<p>XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same data model and support the same functions and 
operators. If you have already studied XPath you will have no problems with understanding 
XQuery.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XQuery - Examples of Use</h2>
<p>XQuery can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract information to use in a Web Service</li>
<li>Generate summary reports</li>
<li>Transform XML data to XHTML</li>
<li>Search Web documents for relevant information</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>XQuery is a W3C Recommendation</h2>
<p>XQuery is compatible with several W3C standards, such as XML, Namespaces, XSLT, XPath, 
and XML Schema.</p>
<p>XQuery 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation January 23, 2007.</p>
