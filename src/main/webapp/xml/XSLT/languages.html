<h1>XSL Languages</h1>
<h2>It Started with XSL</h2>
<p>XSL stands for E<b>X</b>tensible <b>S</b>tylesheet <b>L</b>anguage.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) started to develop XSL because there was a need for 
an XML-based Stylesheet Language.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>CSS = Style Sheets for HTML</h2>
<p>HTML uses predefined tags, and the meaning of each tag is <b>well understood.</b></p>
<p>The &lt;table&gt; tag in HTML defines a table - and a browser knows <b>how to display 
it.</b></p>
<p>Adding styles to HTML elements are simple. Telling a browser to display an element in 
a special font or color, is easy with CSS.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XSL = Style Sheets for XML</h2>
<p>XML does not use predefined tags (we can use any tag-names we like), and therefore the 
meaning of each tag is <b>not well understood.</b></p>
<p>A &lt;table&gt; tag could mean an HTML table, a piece of furniture, or something else - 
and a browser <b>does not know how to display it.</b></p>
<p>XSL describes how the XML document should be displayed!</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XSL - More Than a Style Sheet Language</h2>
<p>XSL originally consisted of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>XSLT - a language for transforming XML documents</li>
<li>XPath - a language for navigating in XML documents</li>
<li>XSL-FO - a language for formatting XML documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, W3C added XQuery (a language for querying XML documents), to the XSL family.</p>
<p>With the CSS3 Paged Media Module, W3C has delivered a new standard for document formatting. 
So, since 2013, CSS3 is proposed as an XSL-FO replacement.</p>
