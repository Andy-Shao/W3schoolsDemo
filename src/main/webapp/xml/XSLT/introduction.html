XML documents.</p>

<h2>XSLT = XSL Transformations</h2>
<p>XSLT is the most important part of XSL.</p>
<p>XSLT is used to transform an XML document into another XML document, or another type of 
document that is recognized by a browser, like HTML and XHTML. Normally XSLT does this by 
transforming each XML element into an (X)HTML element.</p>
<p>With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. You can 
also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to 
hide and display, and a lot more.</p>
<p>A common way to describe the transformation process is to say that <b>XSLT transforms an 
XML source-tree into an XML result-tree.</b></p>
<hr/>

<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>In the transformation process, XSLT uses XPath to define parts of the source document that 
should match one or more predefined templates. When a match is found, XSLT will transform the 
matching part of the source document into the result document.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XSLT Browser Support</h2>
<p>All major browsers have support for XML and XSLT.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>XSLT is a W3C Recommendation</h2>
<p>XSLT became a W3C Recommendation 16. November 1999.</p>
