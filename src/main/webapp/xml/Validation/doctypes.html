<h1>XML Document Types</h1>
<p>An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".</p>
<p>A "Valid" XML document must also conform to a document type definition.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Well Formed XML Documents</h2>
<p>An XML document with correct syntax is "Well Formed".</p>
<p>The syntax rules were described in the previous chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>XML documents must have a root element</li>
<li>XML elements must have a closing tag</li>
<li>XML tags are case sensitive</li>
<li>XML elements must be properly nested</li>
<li>XML attribute values must be quoted</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>An XML Validator</h2>
<p>To help you check the syntax of your XML files, we have created an XML validator to
syntax your XML.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Valid XML Documents</h2>
<p>A "valid" XML document is not the same as a "well formed" XML document.</p>
<p>A "valid" XML document must be well formed. In addition it must conform to a document type
definition.</p>
<p>Rules the defines the legal elements and attributes for XML documents are called Document
Type Definitions (DTD) or XML Schemas.</p>
<p>There are two different document type definitios that can be used with XML:</p>
<ul>
<li>DTD - The original Document Type Definition</li>
<li>XML Schema - An XML -based alternative to DTD</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>When to Use a DTD/Schema?</h2>
<p>With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to use a standard DTD for interchanging
data.</p>
<p>Your application can use a standard DTD to verify that the data you receive from the outside
world is valid.</p>
<p>You can also use a DTD to verify your own data.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>When to NOT to Use a DTD/Schema?</h2>
<p>XML does not require a DTD/Schema.</p>
<p>When you are exprimenting with XML, or when you are working with small XML files, creating 
DTDs may be a waste of time.</p>
<p>If you develop applications, wait until the specification is stable before you add a document
definition. Otherwise, your software might stop working because of validation errors.</p>
