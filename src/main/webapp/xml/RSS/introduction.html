<h1>Introduction to RSS</h1>
<h2>What is RSS?</h2>
<ul>
<li>RSS stands for <b>R</b>eally <b>S</b>imple <b>S</b>yndication</li>
<li>RSS allows you to syndicate your site content</li>
<li>RSS defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content</li>
<li>RSS files can be automatically updated</li>
<li>RSS allows personalized views for different sites</li>
<li>RSS is written in XML</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>Why use RSS?</h2>
<p>RSS was designed to show selected data.</p>
<p>Without RSS, users will have to check your site daily for new updates. This may be too time-consuming for 
many users. With an RSS feed (RSS is often called a News feed or RSS feed) they can check your site faster 
using an RSS aggregator (a site or program that gathers and sorts out RSS feeds).</p>

using an RSS aggregator (a site or program that gathers and sorts out RSS feeds).</p>
<p>Since RSS data is small and fast-loading, it can easily be used with services like cell phones or PDA's.</p>
<p>Web-rings with similar information can easily share data on their web sites to make them better and more useful.</p>

<h2>Who Should use RSS?</h2>
<p>Webmasters who seldom update their web sites do not need RSS!</p>
<p>RSS is useful for web sites that are updated frequently, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>News sites - Lists news with title, date and descriptions</li>
<li>Companies - Lists news and new products</li>
<li>Calendars - Lists upcoming events and important days</li>
<li>Site changes - Lists changed pages or new pages</li>
</ul>
</hr>

<h2>The Future of RSS</h2>
<p>Thousands of sites use RSS, and more people understand its usefulness every day.</p>
<p>With RSS, information on the internet becomes easier to find, and web developers can spread their 
information more easily.</p>
