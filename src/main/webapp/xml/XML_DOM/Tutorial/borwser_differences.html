<h1>XML DOM Browser Differences</h1>
<h2>Browser Differences in DOM Parsing</h2>
<p>All modern browsers support the W3C DOM specification.</p>
<p>However, there are some differences between browsers. One important difference is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way they handle white-spaces and new lines</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>DOM - White Spaces and New Lines</h2>
<p>XML often contains new line, or white space characters, between nodes. This is often the case 
when the document is edited by a simple editor like Notepad.</p>
<p>The following example (edited by Notepad) contains CR/LF (new line) between each line and two 
spaces in front of each child node:</p>
<code><pre>
&lt;book&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Everyday Italian&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;Giada De Laurentiis&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;year&gt;2005&lt;/year&gt;
  &lt;price&gt;30.00&lt;/price&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
</pre></code>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 and earlier do NOT treat empty white-spaces, or new lines as text nodes, 
while other browsers do.</p>
<p>The following example will output the number of child nodes the root element (of books.xml) 
has. IE9 and earlier will output 4 child nodes, while IE10 and later versions, and other browsers 
will output 9 child nodes:</p>
