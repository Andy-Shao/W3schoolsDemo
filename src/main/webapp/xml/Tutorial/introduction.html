<h1>What is XML?</h1>
<ul>
<li>XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language</li>
<li>XML is a markup language much like HTML</li>
<li>XML was designed to describe data, not to display data</li>
<li>XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags</li>
<li>XML is designed to be self-descriptive</li>
<li>XML is a W3C Recommendation</li> 
</ul>
<h1>The Difference Between XML and HTML</h1>
<p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p>
<p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>XML was designed to describe data, with focus on what data is</li>
<li>HTML was designed to display data, with focus on how data looks</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about carrying information.</p>

<h1>With XML You Invent YOur Own Tags</h1>
<p>XML allows the author to define his/her own tags and his/her own document structure.</p>

<h1>XML is Not a Replacement for HTML</h1>
<p><b>XML is a complement to HTML.</b></p>
<p>It is important to understand that XML is not a replacement for HTML. In most web applications, 
XML is used to describe data, while HTML is used to format and display the data.</p>
<p>My best description of XML is this:</p>
<p><b>XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for carrying information.</b></p>
