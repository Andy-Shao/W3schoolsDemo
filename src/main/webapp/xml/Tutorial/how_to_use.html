<p>XML is used in many aspects of web developement, often to simplify data storage and sharing.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>XML Separates Data from HTML</h1>
<p>If you need to display dynamic data in your HTML document, it will take a lot of work to edit the
HTML each time the data changes. With XML, data can be stored in separate XML files. This way you can
concentrate on using HTML/CSS for display and layout, and be sure that changes in the underlying data
will not require any changes to the HTML.</p>
<p>With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an external XML file and update the data content
of your web page.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>XML Simplifies Data Sharing</h1>
<p>In the real world, computer systems and databases contain data in incompatible formats.</p>
<p>XML data is stored in plain text format. This provides a softwar- and hardware-independent way of
storing data.</p>
<p>This makes it much easier to create data that can be shared by different applications.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>XML Simplifies Data Transport</h1>
<p>One of the most time-consuming challenges for developers is to exchange data between incompatible
systems over the Internet.</p>
<p>Exchanging data as XML greatly reduces this complexity, since the data can be read by different
incompatible aplications.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>XML Simplifies Platform Changes</h1>
<p>
Upgrading to new systems (hardware or software platforms), is always time consuming. Large amounts of
data must be converted and incompatible data is often lost.
</p>
<p>XML data is stored in text format. This makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating
systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>XML Makes Your Data More Available</h1>
<p>Different applicatios can access your data, not only in HTML pages, but also from XML data sources.</p>
<p>With XML, your data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines"(Handheld computers, voice 
machines, news feeds, etc.), and make it more available for blind people, or people with other 
disabilities.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Internet Languages Written in XML</h1>
<p>Several Internet languages are written in XML. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>XHTML</li>
<li>XML Schema</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>WSDL</li>
<li>RSS</li>
</ul>
