<h1>Introduction to Web Services</h1>
<p>A few years ago Web services were not fast enough to be interesting.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Web Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>Web services are application components</li>
<li>Web services communicate using open protocols</li>
<li>Web services are self-contained and self-describing</li>
<li>Web services can be discovered using UDDI</li>
<li>Web services can be used by other applications</li>
<li>HTTP and XML is the basis for Web services</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2>Interoperability has Highest Priority</h2>
<p>When all major platforms could access the Web using Web browsers, different platforms couldn't 
interact. For these platforms to work together, Web-applications were developed.</p>
<p>Web-applications are simply applications that run on the web. These are built around the Web browser 
standards and can be used by any browser on any platform.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Web Services take Web-applications to the Next Level</h2>
<p>By using Web services, your application can publish its function or message to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Web services use XML to code and to decode data, and SOAP to transport it (using open protocols).</p>
<p>With Web services, your accounting department's Win 2k server's billing system can connect with your IT 
supplier's UNIX server.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Web Services have Two Types of Uses</h2>
<h3>Reusable application-components</h3>
<p>There are things applications need very often. So why make these over and over again?</p>
<p>Web services can offer application-components like: currency conversion, weather reports, or even language 
translation as services.</p>
<h3>Connect existing software.</h3>
<p>Web services can help to solve the interoperability problem by giving different applications a way to link 
their data.</p>
<p>With Web services you can exchange data between different applications and different platforms.</p>
