<h2>Why SOAP?</h2>
<p>It is important for application development to allow Internet communication between programs.</p>
<p>Today's applications communicate using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) between objects like DCOM and CORBA, 
but HTTP was not designed for this. RPC represents a compatibility and security problem; firewalls and 
proxy servers will normally block this kind of traffic.</p>
<p>A better way to communicate between applications is over HTTP, because HTTP is supported by all Internet 
browsers and servers. SOAP was created to accomplish this.</p>
<p>SOAP provides a way to communicate between applications running on different operating systems, with 
different technologies and programming languages.</p>

<h2>SOAP is a W3C Recommendation</h2>
<p>SOAP became a W3C Recommendation 24. June 2003.</p>
