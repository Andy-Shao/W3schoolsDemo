<p>Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background. etc).</p>
<p>In addition, links can be style differently depending on what <b>state</b> they are in.</p>
<p>The four links states are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a:link - a normal unvisited link</li>
<li>a:visited - a link the user has visited</li>
<li>a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it</li>
<li>a:active - a link the moment it is clicked</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>When setting the style for several link states. there are some order rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited</li>
<li>a:active MUST come after a:hover</li>
</ul>
