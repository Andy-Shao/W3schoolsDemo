<p>By using the @media rule, a website can have a different layout for screen, print, mobile phone, tablet, etc</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Media Types</h3>
<p>Some CSS properties are only designed for a certain media. For example the "voice-family" property is designed for
aural user agents. Some other properties can be used for different media types. For example, the "font-size" property 
can be used for both screen and print media, but perhaps with different values. A document usually needs a larger 
font-size on a screen than on paper, and sans-serif fonts are easier to read on the screen, while serif fonts are easier
to read on paper.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>The @media Rule</h3>
<p>The @media rule allows different style rules for different media in the same style sheet.</p>
<p>The style in the example below tells the browser to display a 14 pixels Verdana font on the screen. But if the page 
is printed, it will be in a 20 pixels font, and in a red color:</p>
<a href="example.html">Example</a>
