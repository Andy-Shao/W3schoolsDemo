<p>With CSS float, an element can be pushed to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.</p>
<p>Float is very often used for images, but it is also useful when working with layouts.</p>

<h3>How Elements Float</h3>
<p>Elements are floated horizontally, this means that an element can only be floated left or right, not up or down.</p>
<p>A floated element will move as far to the left or right as it can. Usually this means all the way to the left or
right of the containing element.</p>
<p>The elements after the floating element will flow around it.</p>
<p>The elements before the floating element will not be affected.</p>
<p>If an images is floated to the right, a following text flows around it, to the left:</p>
<a href="example.html">Example</a>

<hr/>
<h3>Floating Elements Next to Each Other</h3>
<p>If you place several floating elements after each other, they will float next to each other if there is room.</p>
<p>Here we have made an image gallery using the float proerty:</p>
<a href="next_to.html">Example</a>

<h3>Turning off Float - Using Clear</h3>
<p>Elements after the floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property.</p>
<p>The clear property specifies which sides of an element other floating elements are not allowed.</p>
<p>Add a text line into the image gallery, using the clear property:</p>
<a href="using_clear.html">Example</a>
