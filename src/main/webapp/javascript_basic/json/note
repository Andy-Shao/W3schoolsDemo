JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

##What is JSON?
* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
* JSON is lightweight data interchange format
* JSON is language independent
* JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


##The JSON Format Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.



##JSON Syntax Rules
* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays


##JSON Data - A Name and a Values
JSON data is written as name/value pairs, Just like JavaScript object properties.
A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a vaule:
"firstName" : "John"


##JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/values pairs:
{"fristNam":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}


##JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects.
Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).
